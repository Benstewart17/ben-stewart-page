            This was a very basic site built just to introduce myself to the world of coding. it was one of my very first coding projects and I mainly focused on getting the styling of everything down in css. This was practically the start of it all where i learned the basics, gained a basic knowledge on what looks good professionally and generally everything you need to know to get started front end developing.

            This was a similar site that was followed by the yoga project. On this site i was having my own freedom on design and layout. Alink was used to direct you to a different specific page to give information from wikipedia. I also learned the basics of JavaScript. With JavaScript I was able to use a button to pull up a promt to ask a few questions with an input for the user to enter in information. This information is being saved and being used in a response back to the user after all the promts are run through however no real use of information is being gained from an API or any other third party.

           This specific project was my first challenge where i had to really start incorperating a lot of logic to build. With lots of JavaScript I built a fully functional weather app through the popular React language. This website will be able to look up any city and find current actual weather data. Through comunication with an API, this is made possible. Though the styling is basic and uses a little bit of bootstrap, the website mainly focuses on showcasing the logic and skill based behind its functionallity.

            This was my most recent project that I have developed that did not take me a lot of time. I was using this as practice and showing how I am able to comunicate with an API and pullinformation to define words that the user would enter in the form given. This particular API was able to not only give the definition but also have voice-overs on the words given to listen to how they are pronounced, along with a few examples on how the word can be used in a sentence and so forth.
